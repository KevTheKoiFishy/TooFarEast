            >In July of 2021, 4 South Korean middle school students physically
            and sexually assaulted a fellow middle school girl with various
            objects for almost 2 hours. Her crime? Answering a phone call. A
            circulating picture of the 13-year old victim’s bloodied body caused
            immense public outrage; however, due to South Korea’s Juvenile
            Protection Act exempting children aged 10 to 14 from criminal
            punishment, the four perpetrators were released with minimal
            sentencing.&nbsp;</span

            >The issue of bullying has always been prevalent in Korean society.
            According to the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology,
            approximately 1 in 10 primary and secondary school students report
            having been a victim of school bullying. With the exception of the
            installation of more security cameras around schools — which are
            often low-resolution — the South Korean government has failed to
            take initiative to address the issue. Often escaping their misdeeds
            with no more than a mandated apology letter, perpetrators of school
            violence are able attend prestigious universities and live their
            lives as they please. This injustice is especially conspicuous
            within the politically powerful, as can be seen with the recent
            controversy around Chung Sun Sin, the chief of the National Office
            of Investigation and a powerful prosecutor. When Chung’s son’s
            history of verbal bullying came to light, the family utilized the
            political position of Chung Sun Sin to drag the case on for a full
            year. The Chung family dragged what was a simple school bullying
            case all the way to the Supreme Court of Korea to delay consequences
            until Chung’s son, the perpetrator of vicious verbal harassment, was
            accepted into the exalted Seoul National University. The victim of
            the harassment reportedly suffered immense psychological trauma,
            even dropping out of high school after years of being at the top of
            his class.&nbsp;</span

            >Although Chung Sun Sin was eventually pressured to resign from his
            position, the scandal has brought into question the power of status
            and wealth in what claims to be a merit-based democracy. As one SNU
            student put it, “People with money and power just go from strength
            to strength even when they’re guilty of misdeeds, while the
            have-nots are the victims, yet they’re the ones whose future avenues
            get closed off. If that isn’t an unfair, unequal society, what
            is?”</span
