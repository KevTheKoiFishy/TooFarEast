            >On March 13th, 2023, the 95th Academy Award, also known as the
            Oscars, was hosted in the Dolby Theatre. The Oscars stage, one of
            the biggest opportunities for Hollywood actors, actresses, directors
            and even song-writers to shine, is where dreams come true for these
            passionate individuals. Each and every year, a variety of creative
            films and performances showcase to the whole world. Different dreams
            finally, on this day of ceremony, assemble and celebrate for each
            other’s hard work. The Oscars also provides a stage of affirmation
            to bring well-deserved awards to people who work hard toward their
            dream with immense courage and determination. In Oscars 93 years of
            history, no Asian female has ever received the Best Actress Award.
            However, the living legend Michelle Yeoh herself, makes this
            historic victory of becoming the first Asian female Best Actress
            Award winner. The movie “Every Everywhere All at Once” highlights
            her outstanding performance. Moreover, this masterpiece also marked
            a miracle for Chinese Actor, Ke Huy Quan, winning his first Oscars
            marks an important success in his film career.</span

            >Michelle Yeoh was raised in Ipoh, Malaysia. At the age of four,
            Michelle kicked off her journey as a ballerina. She went abroad to
            England for advanced ballet training in the Royal Academy as a teen.
            Michelle’s independence developed from studying abroad at a young
            age. Her first camera debut was in 1984 where she worked with the
            well-known martial arts star–Jackie Chen for a commercial. In 1985,
            she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong.
            Despite that Michelle has never trained in martial arts, she put on
            outstanding performances during the sets with no stunts there to
            complete any shots for her. Learning ballet has taught her to be
            self-disciplined. Michelle became well-known to the Western world
            with the classic actions movie 臥虎藏龍(Crouching Tiger, Hidden
            Dragon) in 2000. Michelle once said: “Before, people saw it (martial
            arts movie) as a fairy tale; they felt they could take it easy. But
            it shouldn't be about that. It's so steeped in our culture, it
            should have more depth to it.” She clearly strongly believes in her
            passion to have her achievement today.&nbsp;</span

            >Ke Huy Quan is a Vietnamese born Chinese-American actor. He works
            mainly as an actor and stunt choreographer. On the day of the
            Oscars, Ke Huy Quan expressed his gratitude to his family and
            himself for having faith in his own movie dream. “My journey started
            on a boat,” he said. “I spent a year in a refugee camp. And somehow,
            I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage. Ke’s life journey has
            never been smooth. He came from a poor family, poverty motivated him
            to study hard as a student. Consequently, he received his film
            degree at USC School of cinematic Art. Standing on one of the
            biggest stages in the world, Ke Huy Quan not just achieved his
            dream, but also proved that all the struggles he went through was
            worth the pain. His teary eyes inspired young bloods to never give
            up on their dreams disregarding how slim it seems to accomplish
            them.</span
