At the age of four, Michelle kicked off her journey as a ballerina. She went abroad to England for advanced ballet training in the Royal Academy as a teen. Michelle’s independence developed from studying abroad at a young age. Her first camera debut was in 1984 where she worked with the well-known martial arts star–Jackie Chen for a commercial. In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. Despite that Michelle has never trained in martial arts, she put on outstanding performances during the sets with no stunts there to complete any shots for her. Learning ballet has taught her to be self-disciplined. Michelle became well-known to the Western world with the classic actions movie 臥虎藏龍(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) in 2000. Michelle once said: “Before, people saw it (martial arts movie) as a fairy tale; they felt they could take it easy. But it shouldn't be about that. It's so steeped in our culture, it should have more depth to it.” She clearly strongly believes in her passion to have her achievement today.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ke Huy Quan is a Vietnamese born Chinese-American actor.

And somehow, I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage. Ke’s life journey has never been smooth. He came from a poor family, poverty motivated him to study hard as a student.
