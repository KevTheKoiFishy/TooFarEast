            >Imagine being forced to live in spaces smaller than an average
            parking space. A flat surrounded by thin walls, low ceilings, and
            little to no light. For many Hong Kongers, this is the affordable
            housing accommodation they could find. As one of Asia’s leading
            financial centers and the gateway to China, Hong Kong is one of the
            wealthiest cities in the region, boasting a strong economy and a
            financial hub for foreign corporations. Hong Kong's strong economy
            attracts many citizens from mainland China and other countries,
            which is a boon and a challenge for the Hong Kong Government. With
            the already large population of 7.5 million and the influx of new
            citizens, zoneable land for residential development in Hong Kong is
            decreasing and the amount of available public housing is
            insufficient. The lack of affordable housing and
            government-subsidized public estates has forced many of Hong Kong’s
            residents to live in tight spaces, many of them having to cram into
            subdivided flats or cage homes, where a normal flat is shared with
            many people. This is the Hong Kong housing crisis.&nbsp;</span

            >There are many reasons behind the current housing crisis in Hong
            Kong. The lack of land availability, the influx of new developments,
            and the way the government manages the land profile. But the key
            reason behind the soaring housing prices and the lack of housing is
            the way Hong Kong was established. When Hong Kong was a British
            colony, the colonial government imposed low taxes and relied instead
            on land sales to generate revenue. This is still the case today—land
            sales are sold for record high prices, creating a system that
            disadvantages the common citizen.</span

            >Recently, a plot of land in Hong Kong’s financial district,
            Central, was leased for an outrageous HKD$30B (USD$3.9B). Many of
            these land transactions are done through auctions, where property
            developers bid the highest to claim the land. Usually, these
            developers come from Mainland China, making astronomically high
            investments for a high return. To make the development profitable,
            investors cater towards the wealthy, building massive, expensive
            luxury housing complexes—complexes that the average resident cannot
            afford.</span

            accelerated housing inflation. Public housing waitlists start at
            five years, precluding many Hong Kongers from that option. This
            leaves few housing solutions for lower-class Hong Kongers: cage or

            between other boxes, providing enough room for a bed and some
            personal belongings. Bathrooms and kitchens are shared with others
            who live in the same flat. On average these spaces cost around HK
            $5000 (USD $640) per month and over 220,000 Hong Kong residents (3
            percent of HK's 7.1 million people) live in these spaces.</span

            years in which there would be 400,000 flats constructed, 70 percent
            public and 30 percent private. Additionally, the government has
            released a new scheme called “Lantau Tomorrow” to develop unused

            will give native Hong Kongers the same problem of long waitlists and
            competition with mainland/foreign settlers. Especially with the
