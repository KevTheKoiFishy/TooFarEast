        <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">China's Economy is Back on Track</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: &quot;Playfair Display&quot;, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Opening up after Zero-Covid Pays Off</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">China is one of the world's largest economies, and its economic situation is closely watched by economists, policymakers, and investors around the world. Recently, the country's economy is slowly recovering from the economic cause covid has caused by them.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After China Dropped its Zero Covid policies, there was a tantrum of covid patients crowding up the hospital and doctors working overtime to take care of everyone. However, by now, things are settling, and the environment is beginning to go back to pre-covid season.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This is evident in everything from the nostalgic traffic jams to the overflowing subway stations in Beijing and Shanghai. Shops along Shanghai’s famous Nanjing Road, the Fifth Avenue of China, are no longer empty. The domestic terminals of big Chinese airports are crowded with travelers going all across the world, with an estimated 400+ thousand people traveling to the middle east. The optimism is also reflected in China’s stock markets, which have risen in recent weeks.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We can also see its growth from how new personal and business loans in China counted to 4.9 trillion yuan, significantly better than the market expectation of 4.1 trillion yuan; among them, long term loans to enterprises grew to 3.5 trillion-yuan, accounting for 71.4% of the overall credit increase.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, a senior government official, Liu He, predicted that “the Chinese economy will make a significant turnaround in 2023.”&nbsp; Because China has a population of over 1.4 billion people, making it the world's most populous country, its market offers significant opportunities for companies and entrepreneurs to sell products and services. So, China’s consumers are an almost irreplaceable source of revenue for homegrown and foreign companies.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">China has become known for its manufacturing capabilities, its factories produce a greater share of the world’s manufacturing output than the United States, Germany and Japan combined. They will also be able to pick up their economy by reopening their factories and exporting more goods.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Schools in China are also opening their gates to welcome students back on campus and the government is planning on supporting and investing in education. This would create new opportunities for growth.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But the path ahead is deeply uncertain. Large parts of China’s population, especially the elderly, are not fully vaccinated, leaving a heightened risk of new Covid variants.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Looking ahead, China's economic growth is likely to be shaped by a range of factors, including its ongoing trade tensions with other countries, its ability to manage its debt levels, and its progress in addressing environmental and social challenges. However, given its large and rapidly growing consumer market, strong manufacturing capabilities, and continued government support, China's economy is likely to remain a key driver of global economic growth in the years to come.</span></p><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></div>
