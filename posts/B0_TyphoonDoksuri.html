Doksuri peaked at Category 4 strength, making it the second-strongest Typhoon so far this year. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the Typhoon has caused flooding across five regions and more than a dozen rain-induced landslides. The storm killed at least 39 people, many of whom were aboard an overcrowded boat that capsized in high winds. In preparation for the Typhoon, coastal communities were evacuated; however, Doksuri still managed to tear off roofs from homes, flood villages with neck-deep waters, and displace nearly 12,000 people as it slammed onto a small island and several other provinces.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lexend, sans-serif; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Taiwan</span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Doksuri has roared to super typhoon strength with winds of 240km/h (149mph) and is headed to waters that separate Taiwan and the Philippines. Taiwan is making emergency preparations as it braces for the impacts of the storm. As it prepares for what may be the biggest Typhoon to strike the island in four years, Taiwan even decided to cancel some of its largest military drills. On July 27, Taiwan began to ​​shut down businesses and cancel flights in the southern part of the island. Kaohsiung and Tainan, two of Taiwan's largest southern cities, have shut down their schools and offices as emergency preparations. Kaohsiung also evacuated residents who live in a mountainous part of the city. The storm has already toppled trees, cut power to more than 278,000 homes across Taiwan, and downed hundreds of trees in Kaohsiung. In addition, more than 200 domestic and international flights were canceled or delayed on July 28, and railway services between southern and eastern Taiwan were obstructed.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lexend, sans-serif; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">China</span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Super Typhoon Doksuri made landfall in Jinjiang in China's southeastern Fujian province on July 28. At this stage, it was bearing winds equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, and the winds around the time of landfall were approaching 175 kilometers per hour (108 mph). This made it the strongest Typhoon to make landfall in the south of China's Fujian Province since 2017. According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, more than 724,600 people had been affected, while more than 416,000 in Fujian had already been evacuated. The impacts of Doksuri caused direct economic losses of 52.27 million yuan ($7.30 million), 39 people were reported to have suffered minor injuries, and more than 500,000 homes lost power. As of Friday afternoon, numerous coastal cities in China, including Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, have temporarily closed businesses, factories, and schools.</span></p><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br></span></div>
