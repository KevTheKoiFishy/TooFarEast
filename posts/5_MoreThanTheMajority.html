            >This past Sunday, millions of Asian families all over the world
            celebrated Lunar New Year, one of the most important holidays for
            many East and Southeast Asian communities. Lunar New Year
            festivities often include large family gatherings, games, and feasts
            of traditional food. Although colloquially known as “Chinese New
            Year”, Lunar New Year celebrations and traditions vary depending on
            the culture one is from: in Vietnam, children may receive li xi,
            small red envelopes filled with money, from family and friends;
            similarly, Korean children learn elaborate bows, called “sebae”, to
            perform in front of their older family members in exchange for extra
            cash. But why exactly do many Asian communities celebrate Lunar New
            Year in late January and early February rather than on January 1st?
            And where, exactly, did these customs originate from?</span

            >Customarily, Lunar New Year is celebrated in a 15-day interval,
            beginning on the first new moon on the lunar calendar and ending on
            the first full moon; the dates typically range from January 21st to
            February 20th on the Gregorian calendar. While many East and
            Southeast Asian countries celebrate the new year based on the
            Chinese lunar calendar, Mongolia and other Turkic regions celebrate
            their new year (Tsagaan Sar) based on the Mongolian lunar calendar,
            meaning that the Tsagaan Sar falls on a different day than the
            majority of Asian new years. The usage of the terminology of
            “Chinese New Year'' to describe all Asian Lunar New Years
            simplistically generalizes all Asian traditions to only the dominant
            majority. “Chinese New Year” is

            >While it’s no doubt that China’s customs and culture had a sweeping
            influence on many parts of Asia, each country that celebrates Lunar
            New Year does it in a unique and beautiful way. The streets of Hanoi
            during Tèt, filled with colorful lanterns, kumquat and peach blossom
            trees, vibrant with Vietnamese culture; the warm Mongolian homes on
            Tsagaan Sar lit with candles and the laughter of family as they
            prepare for spring; and the multitude of other Asian customs deserve
            to be appreciated just as much as the widely-appreciated Chinese
            culture.</span
